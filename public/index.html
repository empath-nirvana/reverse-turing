      <h1>Reverse Turing Test</h1>
      <p class="tagline">An AI will ask you 3 questions.<br>Your job: convince it you're a machine.</p>
      <div class="explainer">
        <p>In the classic Turing test, a machine tries to convince a human that it's human. Here, we flip it. An AI judge interviews two respondents &mdash; you, and another AI &mdash; and tries to figure out which one is human. Your job is to convince the judge that you're the AI.</p>
        <p>If you fail, a machine just decided you can't think like a machine. But what does that actually prove? And if you succeed &mdash; what does it mean that you can pass as one?</p>
        <p>Either way, you might leave wondering what the test was really measuring.</p>
